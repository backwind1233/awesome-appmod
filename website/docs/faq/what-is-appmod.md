- 🐌 **Limited Scalability** - Cannot handle modern workload demands
- 🔒 **Security Vulnerabilities** - Lack modern security features
- 🚫 **Poor User Experience** - Don't meet current user expectations

## App Modernization Benefits

Modernizing your applications provides:

- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Architecture** - Leverage Azure and cloud services
- 📈 **Improved Scalability** - Auto-scaling and elasticity
- 💵 **Reduced Costs** - Lower infrastructure and maintenance costs
- 🔐 **Enhanced Security** - Modern security and compliance features
